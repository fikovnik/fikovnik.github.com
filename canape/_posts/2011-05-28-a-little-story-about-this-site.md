A Little Story About This Site

I have already tried a few times to setup some a personal site where I could
share some information about myself and about the stuff I'm interested in, but
it never really worked out. I was never happy with the design and organization
and so I spent most of time hacking html/css and the wordpress deployment,
instead of focusing on the content itself. Anyway I decided to give it a try
again, but this time with a different approach.

Instead of using wordpress, I went with static webpages generated by
[jekyll][].  With the amount of posts I do, wordpress is really an overkill. I
don't meed most of its features. More over, with jekyll I can write posts using
[Markdown][] and have the entire site versioned on
[github][github-fikovnik.org]. Inspired by [indexhibit][] I created a very
minimalistic layout. Now the content ...
