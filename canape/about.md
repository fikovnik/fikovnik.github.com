I'm from Czech republic, currently living in south of France where I'm pursuing
a PhD in computer science. If you are interested you can have a look at my
[research page]({{ site.baseurl }}/research). The rest of the time I try to do
as much climbing as I can, snowboard and take some photos.

If you want to get in touch with me you can find me on [GitHub][], [Twitter][],
[Mendeley][] or [LinkedIn][] and like other people I also have a [resume][CV].
