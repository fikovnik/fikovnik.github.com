## From the beautiful city of Prague currently exiling in the south of France where I'm pursuing a PhD in computer science. ##

If you are interested you can have a look at my
[research page]({{ site.baseurl }}/research). The rest of the time (and there is not much to be sure) I try to do as much climbing and snowboarding as I can. Oh, and I also take some photos ([some I like]({{ site.baseurl }}/galleries) and [the rest](https://plus.google.com/photos/108299041717917438160/albums?hl=en_US)).

If you want to get in touch with me you can find me on [GitHub][], [Twitter][], [Mendeley][] or [LinkedIn][] and like other people I also have a [resume][CV]. If non of these then you are seriously wasting you time and I'd like to ask you to leave.

Canap√© (this site) is powered by [Jekyll][] using an altered [Columner][] theme.
