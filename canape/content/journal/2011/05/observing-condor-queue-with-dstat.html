For the experiments I do currently I need to observe the behavior of the
[Condor][condor] schedd queue while executing large workflows. What I did
usually was to use a script that would just periodically execute `condor_q` and
together with a timestamp writes the info into a file:

    :::bash
    #!/bin/sh

    while /bin/true; do
      TS=`date +"%d.%m.%Y-%H:%M:%S"`
      CQ=`condor_q | sed '$!d' | cut -f 3 -d ' '`

      echo $TS $CQ
      sleep 1
    done

This works well, however, I usually need to correlate it with some other stats
like memory usage, system load, etc. I like to use [dstat][] for getting these
system information. It has a nice feature to export output to csv file which
can be easily read by [gnuplot][]. The problem is that one has to somehow link
the two different outputs and that can be a bit cumbersome as the execution
time of `condor_q` varies with larger number of jobs. Since dstat uses nice
plugin architecture, I decided to write a [plugin][condor-queue-dstat] that
will grab the queue info.

The usage is simple, just add `--condor-queue` flag to dstat:

    :::console
    $ dstat --condor-queue
    ------condor-queue-----
     jobs  idle runni  held
        5     3     2     0
        5     3     2     0
        4     2     2     0
        3     1     2     0

It requires to have `CONDOR_CONFIG` environment variable set and obviously
condor running. It will try to find to read the config file(s) and expand the
`BIN_DIR` variable to find path to the `condor_q`. Note, that it connects only
to the local queue. The plugin has been merged to the latest master branch of
dstat.
