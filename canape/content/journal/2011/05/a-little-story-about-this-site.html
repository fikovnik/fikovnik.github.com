I have already tried a few times to setup some a personal site where I can
share some information about myself and about the stuff I'm interested in, but
it never really worked out. I was never happy with the design and organization
and so I spent most of time hacking html/css and the wordpress deployment,
instead of focusing on the content itself. Anyway I decided to give it a try
again, but this time vice-versa - focus on the content rather than on the
form.

Instead of using wordpress, I went with static webpages generated by [hyde].
With the amount of posts I do, wordpress is really an overkill. I don't meed
most of its features. More over, with hyde I can write posts using [Markdown][]
and have the entire site versioned on [github][github-fikovnik.org]. Inspired
by [indexhibit][] I created a very minimalistic layout and tried to focus on
good readability.
