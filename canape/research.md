I am pursuing a PhD under [Philippe Collet][philippe] and [Johan
Montagnat][johan] supervision in the [MODALIS][] team in the join [CNRS][]
[I3S][] laboratory [University of Nice][UNS]. My current research deals with
self-adaptive software systems with the focus towards large scale distributed
computing mainly Grids. I am looking into architectural and control models of
various parts of these systems.

I'm part of the [ANR][] Self-Adaptive very Large disTributed sYstems ([SALTY][]) project. 

For the keyword oriented ones:

* Autonomic Computing,
* Grid Computing,
* Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Software Systems,
* Applied Control Theory in Computing Systems,
* Distributed Computing,
* Service and Component Oriented Architectures,
* Model-Driven Engineering.

## Activities 

* Collaboration with University of Wisconsin-Madison on the [Condor project][condor].
* Lecturing in Super Computing and Distributed Systems Camp - [SC-CAMP][] (2010, 2011).

## Publications 
* F. Křikava, P. Collet, _A Reflective Model for Architecting Feedback Control Systems_, In proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2011), Miami, USA, July 2011, IEEE.
* F. Křikava, P. Collet, _Uniform and Model-Driven Engineering of Feedback Control Systems_, In proceedings of the 8th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC 2011), Karlsruhe, Germany, June 2011, ACM.
* P. Collet, F. Krikava, J. Montagnat, M. Blay-Fornarino, and D. Manset, _Issues And Scenarios For Self-Managing Grid Middleware_, Proceeding of the 2nd workshop on Grids meets autonomic computing GMAC 2010, Washington, USA, June 2010 ACM Press.

## Teaching 
* Winter 2010/2011: Introduction to Programming using Python (both M2 Hydroprotech and M2 EuroAquae)
