Currently, I'm a PhD candidate at [French National Centre for Scientific
Research][CNRS] in a computer science lab [I3S][] working on model driven architectures
and engineering of feedback control systems under the supervision of [Philippe
Collet][philippe] and [Johan Montagnat][johan].

The main aim for my research is to provide a tooled approach that would assist
researches and engineers in designing, implementing and validating feedback
control for computing systems. The idea is to provide a platform for rapid
prototyping for such systems. One of the main use cases I am using for
validating this approach is modeling adaptive behavior in Condor distributed
batch system. I am working on an adaptive workflow execution, in this case
maintaining high-throughput while preventing system overload.

My work is part of the [ANR][] Self-Adaptive very Large disTributed sYstems ([SALTY][]) project.
