The vision of autonomic computing and self-adaptive software systems aims at realizing software that autonomously manage itself in presence of varying environmental conditions.
Feedback control loops provide generic mechanisms for self-adaptation, however, incorporating them into software systems raises many challenges.
In my research I focus on the integration challenge, _i.e._, forming an architecture connection between the underlying adaptable software and the adaptation engine through the use of domain-specific modeling language for specifying self-adaptive software architectures.

Another part of my research is in model manipulation languages. 
In particular, the design and development of internal Domain-Specific Languages for automating model consistency checking and model transformations tasks.
