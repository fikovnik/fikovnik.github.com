## From the city of Prague currently exiling in south of France where I'm pursuing a PhD in computer science. ##

If you are interested you can have a look at my [research
page](research.html). The rest of the time (and there is not much of it to
be sure) I try to do some climbing and snowboarding. Oh,
and I also take some photos (here are the few [I like](galleries.html)
and [the rest][picassa]). If you want to get in touch with me you can
find me on [GitHub][], [Twitter][], [Mendeley][] or [LinkedIn][] and
like other people I also have a [resume][CV].
