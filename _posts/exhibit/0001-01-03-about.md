## From the city of Prague currently exiling in the north of France doing a research in computer science. ##

I am a postdoctoral fellow at University of Lille 1 - LIFL and a member of the INRIA [SPIRALS team](https://team.inria.fr/spirals/) since November 2013. 
I completed my PhD thesis at University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (France) in the CNRS [I3S laboratory](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/), under the supervision of [Philippe Collet](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~collet/) and [Johan Montagnat](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/~johan/). 
My main research interests are in applying model driven engineering to develop self-adaptive software systems.  If you are interested you can have a look at my [research
page](research.html). Next to research I also participate in some [open source development](http://github.com/fikovnik/). 

I laso do some climbing, skiing, snowboarding and take [photos](galleries.html).

Like other people I also have a [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pu0v7bOq5B2yUVAR7kzgAyzaye1xNNhzaKZOoCytcFc/edit?hl=en_US&authkey=CILzkOIC).
