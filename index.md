I am an associate professor at Czech Technical University in the [Faculty of Information Technology](https://fit.cvut.cz/en) doing research at programming language research lab [PRL](http://prl-prg.github.io).
My research interest is in analyzing programming languages.
Currently I work on static and dynamic analysis of R and Scala.

Before I was a postdoc in the [PRL](https://prl.khoury.northeastern.edu/) group at Northeastern University and at INRIA in the [SPIRALS](https://team.inria.fr/spirals/) team.
I did my PhD at CNRS in the [MODALIS](http://modalis.polytech.unice.fr/) team.
I used to work on model-driven engineering and self-adaptive software systems, facilitating systematic integration of adaptation mechanisms into software with an application to large scale distributed systems.

I also did work in industry: LaceWork (2022-2023), ORACLE (2015-2016), TomTom (2007-2009), Sun Microsystems (2005-2007), Accenture (2004).
