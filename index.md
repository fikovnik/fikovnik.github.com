I am an assistant professor at Faculty of Information Technology at Czech Technical University. Before I was a postdoctoral fellow at University of Lille 1 - LIFL and a member of the INRIA Lille [SPIRALS](https://team.inria.fr/spirals/) team and a PhD candidate at CNRS.
My main research interest is in model-driven engineering and self-adaptive software systems.
Concretely, I am looking into how MDE techniques can facilitate a systematic integration of adaptation mechanisms into software with an application to large scale distributed systems.
I'm also a principal member of technical staff at ORACLE working on a next generation of cloud services.
