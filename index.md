I am a researcher in [PRL](http://prl-prg.github.io) group at Czech Technical University.
Before I was a postdoc at INRIA Lille in the [SPIRALS](https://team.inria.fr/spirals/) team and a PhD candidate at CNRS in the [MODALIS](http://modalis.polytech.unice.fr/) team.
My research interest is in analyzing programming languages.
Currently I work on static and dynamic analysis of R and Scala.
Before I was working on model-driven engineering and self-adaptive software systems, facilitating systematic integration of adaptation mechanisms into software with an application to large scale distributed systems.

I was also working at some tech companies - ORACLE, TomTom, Sun Microsystems, Accenture.
