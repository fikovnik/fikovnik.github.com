# ABOUT

I am a postdoctoral fellow at University of Lille 1 - LIFL and a member of the INRIA Lille [SPIRALS team](https://team.inria.fr/spirals/) (since November 2013). 
I completed my PhD thesis at University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (France) in the CNRS [I3S laboratory](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/), under the supervision of Philippe Collet and Johan Montagnat. 
My main research interests relates to model driven engineering to self-adaptive software systems.
Concretely, I am looking into how MDE techniques can facilitate a systematic integration of adaptation mechanisms into software with an application to large scale distributed systems.
Next to research I also participate in some [open source development](http://github.com/fikovnik/). 

I also do some climbing, skiing, snowboarding and take [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/121532543@N04/).

# RESEARCH

The vision of autonomic computing and self-adaptive software systems aims at realizing software that autonomously manage itself in presence of varying environmental conditions.
Feedback control loops provide generic mechanisms for self-adaptation, however, incorporating them into software systems raises many challenges.
In my research I focus on the integration challenge, _i.e._, forming an architecture connection between the underlying adaptable software and the adaptation engine through the use of domain-specific modeling language for specifying self-adaptive software architectures.

Another part of my research is in model manipulation languages. 
In particular, the design and development of internal Domain-Specific Languages for automating model consistency checking and model transformations tasks.
