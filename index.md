I am a postdoctoral fellow at University of Lille 1 - LIFL and a member of the INRIA Lille [SPIRALS](https://team.inria.fr/spirals/) team (since November 2013). 
I completed my PhD thesis at University of Nice Sophia Antipolis (France) in the CNRS [I3S laboratory](http://www.i3s.unice.fr/), under the supervision of Philippe Collet and Johan Montagnat. 
My main research interests relates to model driven engineering to self-adaptive software systems.
Concretely, I am looking into how MDE techniques can facilitate a systematic integration of adaptation mechanisms into software with an application to large scale distributed systems.
Next to research I also participate in some [open source development](http://github.com/fikovnik/). 

I also do some climbing, skiing, snowboarding and take [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/121532543@N04/).
